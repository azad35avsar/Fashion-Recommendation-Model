**🖊️ Project Purposes:** The model will be trained with a CSV file with clothing images and labels of the features and clothing names corresponding to these images. Our aim in the trained model is to predict the features of the clothes in the externally provided image and then make suggestions based on other clothes with similar labels. The recommendation will be made based on the photographs in our dataset.
